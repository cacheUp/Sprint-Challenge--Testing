1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

- `Describe()` creates a block that groups together several related tests. `it()` creates a test case. `Describe()` is good for grouping similar tests scenrarios and `it()` is good for testing specific cases.

2. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

- To create tests and build software that must pass the tests. It is very tedios to write the tests but I can see the advantages when there is a huge enterprise application. It can help figure out what went wrong during an update and can rollback to a version where the application passes all of the tests.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.

- TDD
- BDD
- ATDD
